Component-Based Architecture: Each part of the UI is separated into reusable components.


State Management: Using useState to store products, form data, and search terms.


Data Flow via Props: Parent component (App) passes data and functions to child components.


Rendering Lists: Using .map() to display products in a table.


Event Handling: Handling form submission, edit, delete, and search operations.


Conditional Rendering: Showing different UI when editing or adding a new product.
